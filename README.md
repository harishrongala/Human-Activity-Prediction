# Human-Activity-Prediction

This document aims to predict how accurately “Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl” is performed by the
user. Wearable sensors comprised of Inertial measurement units (IMU) provides the data
required. In this document machine learning algorithms rpart, gradient boosting and random forests
were used to predict/classify the activity. This document also discusses the model built, cross-validation and
out of sample errors.
